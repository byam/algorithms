## How to prepare

For each problem we might encounter, do the following.

1. **Try to solve the problem on your own**. (make sure think about *time* and *efficiency*)
2. **Write the code on paper**. Coding on a computer offers luxuries such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and quick debugging. Coding on paper does not. Get used to this and to how slow it is to write and edit code by coding on paper.
3. **Test your code on paper**. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, and soon. You'll need to do this during your interview, so it's best to practice this in advance.
4. **Type your paper code as-is into a computer**. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a list of all the errors you make so that you can keep these in mind during the actual interview.
